Pinpoints changes from when the file worked, one of which 
must lead to the bug.

Allows you to try out ideas, move through versions while
allowing restoration of previous versions to address
compatibility. Plus allows easier tracking of changes in
group projects.

Pros - versions make sense and offer a functional change
and compile. Easier to read history.
Cons - makes it susceptible to user error.

Different functions of documents, for the most part google 
docs will not depend on the other. Code on the other hand
often pulls in functions from other files.

Git log provides reference ids and messages that give 
to each file.

Git diff points out differences in files, what was added,
what was taken away.

You can make changes safe in the knowledge that it is easy 
to return to the earlier version if anything breaks. Whole
different strategies and versions can be tried without 
risk.

Upload previous projects should I go back to them, as 
repositories, and for current projects for reasons above.
