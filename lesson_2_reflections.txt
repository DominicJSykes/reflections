The git folder gets created which is necessary to store
all the metadata git requires to function.

The staging area allows flexibility in what shall be 
updated in each commit, allowing the best practice of 
one logical change per commit to be adhered to.

Changes can be staggered using the staging area, with
each being uploaded to contain one logical change.

Branches enable new changes or features to be tried 
without jeopardising the whole program. Or for variations
to be created with ease.

It portrays where branches have happened and which 
commits are reachable from each branch.

Merging two branches creates a commit with changes from 
both branches, including adds and
removes. The diagram reflects this by linking
changes from both branches to the new commit.

Automatic merges through Git enables them to be done 
quicker as well as in a more structured way, vs them
being down manually, meaning troubleshooting may be
more predictable. However manual enables maximum 
control and flexibility and may help with not 
duplicating code in different places of the file, if
code is moved.
