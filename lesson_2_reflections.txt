The git folder gets created which is necessary to store
all the metadata git requries to function.

The staging area allows flexibility in what shall be 
updated in each commit, allowing the best practice of 
one logical change per commit to be adhered to.

Changes can be staggered using the staging area, with
each being uploaded to contain one logical change.

Branches enable new changes or features to be tried 
without jepardising the whole program. Or for variations
to be created with ease.

It portrays where branches have happened and which 
commits are reachable from each branch.

Merging two branches creates a commit with changes from both branches, including adds and
removes. The diagram reflects this by linking
changes from both branches to the new commit.
