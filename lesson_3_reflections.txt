A remote repository is useful to both have an accessible
backup available from any computer with an internet 
connection, as well as enabling collaborative work and 
sharing to be far easier.

Pulling the repository manually means that changes made 
by others on the project won't be intergrated with your
work before it's ready, avoiding conflicts.

A branch is a new version of the existing project, enabling
changes to be made without affecting the existing branches.
A clone is a copy of the repository linked by a remote to 
the original. Changes in the clone won't affect the original
but can be pushed to it. A fork is a clone that takes place
on GitHub, normally cloning to anothers profile.
