A remote repository is useful to both have an accessible
backup available from any computer with an internet 
connection, as well as enabling collaborative work and 
sharing to be far easier.

Pulling the repository manually means that changes made 
by others on the project won't be intergrated with your
work before it's ready, avoiding conflicts.
